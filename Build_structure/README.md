## Build Structure to create a RPM using CMake

> Keep the `build.sh` and `Source_CMakeLists.txt` file in the source directory(Parent Directory).

> Keep the `SubDir_CMakeLists.txt` file in the subdirectories.

> Create a `.VERSION` file in the source directory.

Edit all the files according to you requirements. Also make sure to add command to make rpm. The command in the given scripts is custom. We can also use some other commands to build a project.
